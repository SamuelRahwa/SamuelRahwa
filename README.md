### Hey y'all! My name is Sam Rahwa and I'm starting my career in the Tech Field. I recently graduated from the Flatiron School's Data Science Program and with an MBA in Finance from the University of Denver. I was born, raised and currently reside in Denver, Colorado. I'm the youngest of three siblings and a lot of cousins. I would also argue that mac and cheese should be eaten with a fork, not a spoon.

> My favorite cheesy data sciecne joke is: 
>> I have a machine learning joke, but it is not performing as well on a new audience.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on neural networks and time series comparisons for predicting and forecasting stock prices. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R and brushing up on my query languages.
- :smiley: My hobbies and passions are weightlifting, reading, economics, cooking, hiking and hanging out with my dogs.
